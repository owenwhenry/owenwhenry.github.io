Hi. I'm Owen. Sometimes I write things here. 

I live in Baltimore, MD, where I moved in 2016 with my then-girlfriend-now-wife. 
She's a rad person and I love her, I hope you're lucky enough to meet her one day.

We live with a pair of cats, who are terrorists on paws. 

I mostly work with data and bureaucracy, so be prepared to read about both.
